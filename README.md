# HEXY.PRO - The Open-Source Hexagonal Map Creator

![HEXY.PRO Screenshot](/banner.png)

Welcome to **HEXY.PRO**, a powerful and intuitive hexagonal map creator designed for world-builders, game developers, and TTRPG masters. What started as a commercial project has now been reborn for the community. We've gone open-source to empower creators everywhere, and we're inviting you to help us shape its future!

Our decision to open-source means that some of our most ambitious, server-side features have been temporarily disabled. We see this not as a setback, but as a **massive opportunity** for the open-source community to step in, innovate, and build something incredible together.

## üîì The Open-Source Opportunity: Help Us Rebuild!

When we decided to open-source HEXY.PRO, we had to disable our core commercial, server-side features. The code and workflows are still in the repository, waiting for talented developers to revive them in a new, open way.

Here's what's currently offline and where you can make a huge impact:

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Tile Generation (Currently Disabled)

This was our flagship feature: a self-hosted image generation pipeline that allowed users to create unique tiles on the fly.

-   **The Goal:** Allow users to generate tile assets using descriptive prompts (e.g., "a lush forest tile with a small stream").
-   **Original Implementation:** Used a **ComfyUI** workflow with **Stable Diffusion** to generate images. An **Ollama-powered LLM** was being integrated to help translate user prompts into effective generation parameters.
-   **Current Status:** The backend services for this are offline. The workflows and some server code are still present in the `/comfyapi/` and `/server/` directories. This is a perfect opportunity to reintegrate these services or architect a new, community-hosted solution.

### üí≥ Stripe Subscription Integration (Currently Disabled)

The AI generation features were supported by a subscription model.

-   **The Goal:** Manage user subscriptions for premium features.
-   **Original Implementation:** Used **Stripe** for handling payments and managing user tiers.
-   **Current Status:** The routes and logic in `/server/routes/stripeRoutes.js` are disabled. This could be repurposed for community-based support models (donations, etc.) or other creative uses.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to jump in? Here's how to get the development environment running.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Manacaster/hexy.git
    cd hexy/app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Supabase:**
    -   Go to [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    -   In the root of the `/app` folder, create a new file named `.env`.
    -   Find your project's API URL and `anon` key in your Supabase project's "API Settings".
    -   Add them to your `.env` file:
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    -   Run the SQL queries provided in the `supabase_setup` directory to create the necessary tables and policies. *(Note: We will be adding these files in a future commit.)*

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on your local machine!
